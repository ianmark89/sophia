## The guy who wanted a computer when everybody wanted a calculator

The history of the first Intel processor that could be used
on a relatively low cost personal computer starts with a guy
(which I don't remember the name) that could not accept
the fact that the difference between a processor for a calculator
and a general purpose processor was minimal.

He had a hard timing selling his idea because he lacked the
hability to stop projecting himself on others. People in general
do not want to program computers, they just want to use them. Like
using a calculator instead of programming one. Programmin one seems
cool for a hacker, but almost no one is.

Besides this rough start, Intel ended up building microprocessors
that later would be used on the first personal computer.

## MITS 

MITS was Ed Roberts child, born from the dream of personal
computer. On that time almost every pursuit for a personal
computer was from hackers, it was not seem as a good business
idea (the logic was, if it was a good idea why is not IBM doing it).

MITS was on the calculator business, and was completely crushed
by texas instruments when it came to that market. Ed Roberts was
crushed and his last move before completely going bankrupt was a
shot at personal computing. It was a hail Mary, and it worked.

We got Intel processor 8080 at a extremelly low price, since he
bought them in a huge batch (hundreds of thousands) and convinced
the bank to loan the money.

Not it was glory or utter failure and enourmous debt for him.
Here the Altair has been born. A personal computer programmed
with switches and leds, nothing more than this.

Luckly the desire for personal computer was so intense, that even
a machine so crude as the Altair. Even chess was being played with
the Altair, it was amazing what people where doing with it.
Things went from really bad to really good for MITS.

When things where really good, Ed Roberts started to make a
series of very stupid mistakes.

What was driving the computer business at this time (CIRCA 1970-1972)
was the community of hardware hobbyists, and they shared a lot with
the hacker ethic. They had the Homebrew Computer Club, and all information
was freely shared, the ideas did not belonged to anyone and a lot
of companies where being formed.

At this time there was some effort to build a standard bus based
on the Altair bus. What made computers great where the bus that enabled
you to extend the machine with new cards, extending memory and adding
new I/O devices.

Ed Roberts started having a stupid behavior when the community started
to grow. He acted like the whole personal computer thing was his idea
and belonged to him. He went to extremes of not inviting other companies
to events that he promoted.

Inevitably everyone gathered together, defined a bus called S-100 and
left MITS behind. Ed Roberts failed to acknowledge the requirement
of openness on this stage of the computer revolution.

Also he went full retard and simply started to ignore all its employees.
Eventually even the market was being ignored by him.
I saw this happening in my life once, so it was interesting
to read about the same history in the past.

Lesson: Never alienate yourself from your staff and pay attention
to the community that supports your business.

## IMSAI

The history of IMSAI is very interesting. IMSAI was the first company
to build personal computers that was driven by business people, instead
of hardware hackers. By personal computer understand altair, really at
the beggining of everything.

It was the traditional high on crack "make a miracle" thing pulled
by people that just wanted to sell the a shitload of computers.

The cultural difference was so intense that it reflected fisically
on the disposition of the teams. There was two buildings, one for
sales and another one for enginnering. The only communication that
existed was unidirectional, basically orders for more and more computers.

They really sold a lot of stuff and got a lot of money, but it was not
sustainable. Eventually all the concerns from the enginnering team
materialized, they started to deliver half baked crap and did not even
had a proper service to respond to unsatisfied clients, even basically
QA was missing.

One time a computer was delivered with a screw driver inside of it, people
where burning out. The competitive/agressive model of the business people
was not a good fit for engineers which are much more collaborative and
creative, usually not that interested on getting rich.

In the end the company went bankrupt.

This is not about "business is bad". There is a lot of smaller companies
that also went bankrupt for lack of business view, one example is Processor
Technology, they had the opportunity to be an Apple, but they lacked the
business view to make it happen, lacked the focus, it was too much
hacking and in the end it also disappeared.

In the end balance seems to be the key for a sustainable company.
But with two cultures that are so different, balance is a true challenge.

## Apple 3

Apple started as a open architecture company, the computer was
completely open and the design of extensions to it was encouraged.
This was a reflection of Steve's Wozniak devotion to the hacker
ethic and the open flow of information.

Both Apple 1 and Apple 2 where designs from Woz, embedding his
desire to design the perfect computer, for himself.

Apple 2 was what sustained Apple through a VERY long time, and
started a game industry for it that was multi millionaire (there is
an entire section on the Hackers Heroes Of The Computer Revolution book).

The Apple 3 on the other hand was designed by commitee with a lot
of marketing decisions influencing the design of the machine, and a lot
of pressure to deliver before it was done.

It was a total piece of crap and Apple took a big blow on its public image.
One that was very hard to recover from. A great constrast between love and
criativity and the sheer desire to sell and make money, criativity won this
one by far.

It is very interesting how later Apple adapted to be more secretive and
evolved as a product that has great UX, people that use it today are no
longer hackers, but people who like pretty computers with good UX.

They where able to adapt, in great part thanks to Steve Jobs which had
a clear vision of the market and what people wanted, but never settled with
crap as a product, quality mattered.

## IBM Master Move

IBM impressed me on how they reinvented itself on the PC market.
Everyone was on the tension that IBM would enter the market and
dominate it. And it really happened, but the how is the most
surprising.

IBM entered the PC market with a completely open platform, the hardware
was completely open and following industry standards, there where
no secrets, no proprietary CI's, hackers would open up the machine
and recognize everything.

This allied with IBM power resulted on the obliteration of almost
all companies building computers at the time, with exception of Apple.

It was a surprise for all how IBM was able to NOT be IBM. Even the
deal that they made with Microsoft for a operational system allowed
Microsoft to sell the system for other platforms too.

IBM identified that the market at that time required openness and
they where able to embrace it.

## Epilogue: Technology as a reflection of us

The whole book makes you think on how technology is a reflection
of us. Personal computers started on a time that people where
striving to empower individuals. Only big companies where able
to have computers, on a time that big companies where seem as
evil war machines.

Computers where even seen as something evil, only used for war.
At that time a small group of people started to see that actually
that same power could be used for people, projects like Community
Memory emerged, to give people access to computer power, to change
people's lifes.

And this happened, happened on ways that no one was able to predict.
Not a single corporation of the time was able to foresee it, because
the vision was not business, not money, it was a revolution from
individuals to favor another individuals.

The first computers and software reflected this spirit. But as computers
got adopted, more people where inserted on this community, people with
different views, people that did not wanted to change the world, just
wanted to have fun with computers and get their job's done.

The state of computers today reflect this, the biggest part
of the market, where the money really is, is focused on usability and
entertaining people, or solving their day to day problems. As this happens
the focus shifted from personal computers and goes to smaller mobile
devices, people have no interest on opening these machines or knowing
how they work, they just want the results. The most obvious reflection
of that is the explosion of social networks.

Human beings in general are social beings, technology is catalyzing that.
But to make this happen today we still have the same old good hackers,
building tools that make tools just for the sake of it =).
