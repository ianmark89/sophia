## MITS 

MITS main failure was the owner agressiveness against
other companies that where starting, the agressiveness was
recognized as a failure to embrace the hacker ethic.

Also he went full retard and simply started to ignore all
its employees while it pursued it's own personal ghosts.

Lesson: Never alienate yourself from your staff

## IMSAI

The history of IMSAI is very interesting. IMSAI was the first company
to build personal computers that was driven by business people, instead
of hardware hackers. By personal computer understand altair, really at
the beggining of everything.

It was the traditional high on crack "make a miracle" thing pulled
by people that just wanted to sell the a shitload of computers.

The cultural difference was so intense that it reflected fisically
on the disposition of the teams. There was two buildings, one for
sales and another one for enginnering. The only communication that
existed was unidirectional, basically orders for more and more computers.

They really sold a lot of stuff and got a lot of money, but it was not
sustainable. Eventually all the concerns from the enginnering team
materialized, they started to deliver half baked crap and did not even
had a proper service to respond to unsatisfied clients, even basically
QA was missing.

One time a computer was delivered with a screw driver inside of it, people
where burning out. The competitive/agressive model of the business people
was not a good fit for engineers which are much more collaborative and
creative, usually not that interested on getting rich.

In the end the company went bankrupt.

This is not about "business is bad". There is a lot of smaller companies
that also went bankrupt for lack of business view, one example is Processor
Technology, they had the opportunity to be an Apple, but they lacked the
business view to make it happen, lacked the focus, it was too much
hacking and in the end it also disappeared.

In the end balance seems to be the key for a sustainable company.
But with cultures that are so different, balance is a true challenge.

## Apple 3

The interesting history about the Apple 1/2 designed by Woz
and Apple 3 designed by commitee and marketers :-).

## IBM master move

Elaborate how IBM reinvented itself on the PC market.

## Epilogue: Technology as the mirror of us

Reflect on how the start of the PC reflected the hackers
and hobbystis community and their values, and how this
evolved (relates to Apple for example).
