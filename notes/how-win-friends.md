## Just thinking on what you are going to say next

I do this all the time and it is awful, the best thing to do is truly listen to
the person, instead of just listening pretty fast until I got my chance to talk.

This is a sign of an inflated ego and wrong sense of self importance.


## People love their own names

Cool history about how a kid with 8 years old convinced all its friends
to find food to its rabbits just by proposing to name the rabbits after them.

Humans do all kind of stuff to get their names on stuff, like libraries and
hospitals. Give them sense of importance by using this.


## Being ruthless as a mean to be awesome

Now I think this is just plain bullshit. I thought being blunt and always criticizing if
something was not ok was better. In part is because if someone do this with me, usually I do
not care, and if I was really wrong, I enjoy it.

But this is another mistake that I'm always making, **people are NOT like me** and I cant expect
them to be. In general people respond to praise.

Praise is harder and more effective than criticizing, I need to think on ways to criticize
that involve praising first. Two interesting techniques:

* Always praise before talking about a mistake, makes it easier
* Talk how I myself have done similar mistakes on the past
