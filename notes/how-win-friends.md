# How to win friends and influence people


## Interesting points

* Retrospectives being done since 1930 :-)
* Dont criticize people, understand them
* If you want honey, dont kick the beehive
* People want to be important and appreciated
* People can even go crazy without appreciation
* Speak no harm, focus on the qualities
* Inspire people so they get eager to do stuff, instead of just commanding
* Find out what people want and care about that
* Everyone is in love with its own name, use this
* Listening to someone is one of the best compliments
* Encourage others to talk about themselves


## Just thinking on what you are going to say next

I do this all the time and it is awful, the best thing to do is truly listen to
the person, instead of just listening pretty fast until I got my chance to talk.

This is a sign of an inflated ego and wrong sense of self importance.


## People love their own names

Cool history about how a kid with 8 years old convinced all its friends
to find food to its rabbits just by proposing to name the rabbits after them.

Humans do all kind of stuff to get their names on stuff, like libraries and
hospitals. Give them sense of importance by using this.
