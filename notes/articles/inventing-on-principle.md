# Inventing on Principle

Notes from the presentation [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366).

Not actually an article =).

This presentation is extremely awesome and inspiring.

It starts by an explanation of how a principle can guide you career
and then elaborates on the presenter's principle, that creators should have
fast connection with what they are creating.

What does that mean ? It is about feedback, the feedback of changes
on what is being created should be immediate and as clear as possible.

All examples on the presentation are about graphics, in this case it is
really easy to see how you can augment the connection between the creator
and the creation. Basically while you change code you must be able to
see the results IMMEDIATELY (removing the compile and run from the equation).

He even shows how to apply that on a game on the time dimension, it is pretty
cool. It has features that helps you map the results in the screen to what
part of the code is responsible to that, and vice-versa (remembers some features
of some browser debuggers and the DOM of pages).

Fast interactivity is a game changer, it reminds me of a part of the book
Hackers Heroes of The Computer Revolution where it is described the impact
that the PDP-2 computer had on MIT, specially because it had a interactive
nature, instead of the batch process style of the IBM machines. A fast
feedback loop is essential to the creative process.

Another cool history is the one about the
[first human powered flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-powered_aircraft), that
was also based on fast feedback, MacCready created a plane that was so simple
and cheap that when it crashed it was really fast to rebuild it and try again,
after setting up this environment the "try -> fail -> try again" loop initiated
and eventually (few months) the first man powered flight was achieved.

There is a lots of development methodologies that seems related to this idea
of connecting creators with their creation, like:

* TDD (small steps always running tests, tests are the feedback)
* DevOps (feedback about operational quality of your code)
* MVP (feedback from users)

DevOps is more recent and comes from the problem that arises when you
disconnect the person that is creating software from how it works in
production, without the feedback the developer has no clear idea on
how to improve this aspect of code.

The most inspiring part is on the end when he explains that there is
three type of people:

* Craftsman (focused on being very good on a skill)
* Problem Solver (entrepreneurship)
* Principled

Well, what would be the difference ? The principled person do not see
the absence of the principle he believes as an opportunity, he sees it
as a moral responsibility for correction. It is not a problem to solve or
something related to business, it is a social issue, you believe that
something is wrong and must be fixed. This thing that is wrong is usually
only seem by you or a minority of people at first. But you believe on it
and fight for it anyway, in a lot of ways it works like a social cause.

Usually social causes involves organizing people and creating movements
(an example is the one that allowed women to vote), but on the technical area
this can also be done by inventing.

One example that is elaborated is the guy that invented most of all
resources of modern text editors that are not modal. The modal interface
(like vim) was terrible for almost all people, and he was worried that
this would keep people away from computers, something that was wrong for
him, people needed to feel comfortable on computers because that would
change the world.

So in a time that everyone thought that modal text editors where the obvious
way he invented a text editor that have a lot of features that text
editors have today, with no modes. Things we take for granted like control+c
and control+v was invented on this context, on a time that people did not
see that as a problem.

That is why having a principle is not the same thing on problem solving,
people did not even see it as a problem at the time, yet he worked on that
because he believe that it was wrong to make it so hard for people to
interface with computers (social aspect).

His principle was "dont trap me in a mode", this guided all his work.
Everything he invented was inspired by this idea of interaction without
modes.

In the end, there is no problem on being a craftsman or a problem solver,
but it is true that this option of being principled and having a caused
is almost never mentioned on software development as an option to live
your like and guide your career.

Finding a principle takes time, and involves doing a lot of work, and
a lot of work on different areas. Perhaps someday I will find one =).
