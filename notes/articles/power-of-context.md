# The Power Of Context

These are the notes from the awesome
[The Power Of Context](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2004001_power.pdf)
article from Alan Kay.

One of the things that I identified myself most was with how
the most important thing to him on the work done at ARPA/PARC
where about people and how they communicated and treated each
other.

Of course they where well educated people and had awesome ideas,
but just as happened with how the American constitution was formed,
it was the good will of the people involved that really enabled things
to happen, not just the sheer power of intelligence aggregated.

The idea that context matters is not new, but Alan Kay has a cool
phrase that is also mentioned on his talk
[Rethinking CS Education](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9c7_8Gp7gI)
which is "Point of view is worth 80 IQ points", and this change on
point of view is usually enabled by being inserted on the right context,
quoting the text:

```
A fish on land still waves its
fins, but the results are qualitatively different when the fish is put
in its most suitable watery environment
```

The metaphor makes the point brilliantly. A great part of the start of the
article is about him thanking all the great people that helped and
enabled him, this is also something that I can related deeply, like this:

```
Similarly, when I think of ARPA/PARC, I think first of good
will, even before brilliant people. Dave Evans, my advisor,
mentor, and friend was simply amazing in his ability to act as
though his graduate students were incredible thinkers
```

This shows how important mentors are on our area of work (just as in
any other one that involves human beings =P). Being able to let
your ego aside and enable and encourage people is fundamental and
this seems harder to find on our area, as more money is put on something
more people are attracted to it, and people that are attracted by
money usually do not show this kind of quality.

Also it really makes the point on how experienced people can catalyse
the work of other less experienced people. If Dave Evans thought about
his job/productivity as a product of how much code he wrote, or how
much products/research he produced, he would probably never bother to
help Alan Kay. A good mentor can be much more productive by getting
10 good young people and multiplying all them by 10, he would never
be able to exert this kind of impact on the world alone.

## Funding and Management

There is a lot of cool ideas about funding and management, and how
this happened on ARPA/PARC. Quoting from the text:

```
For example, it is no
exageration to say that ARPA/PARC had "visions rather than
goals" and "funded people, not projects".
```

I think the idea is not that this kind of funding is the better
one for all kinds of companies, but of your company is trying to
"capture the heavens" by doing something truly unique it will
need at least some portion of this kind of funding happening or
the chances of something truly unique to happen will be small.

Why would goals be bad ? Each individual had its own goals, the fact
that only a vision existed on the funding model enabled each one to pursue
goals that besides being aligned with the view where considerable
different. Quoting from the text:

```
By not trying to
derive specific goals from this at the funding side, ARPA/PARC
was able to fund rather different and sometimes opposing points
of view. For example, Engelbart and McCarthy had extremely
different ways of thinking of the ARPA dream, but ideas from
VPRI Memo M-2004-001 3
both of their research projects are important parts of today's
interactive computing and networked world. 
```

Both McCarthy and Engelbart produced **VERY** concrete results,
the idea to fund people and just give a vision is not to enable people
to goof around all the time thinking without never delivering
something usable. A great example is
[The mother of all demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY)
from Engelbart. It shows stuff that seems impossible at the time,
and things are very concrete and functional, something that we would
call today an MVP =).

Well, and how was management done ? Before going deeper on this subject
it is important to establish the minimum requirements to be part of
the team:

```
ARPA/PARC had two main thresholds: self-motivation and
ability. They cultivated people who "had to do, paid or not" and
"whose doings were likely to be highly interesting and
important". 
```

This reminds me of the "racing sheep" and "herding horses" metaphor
from the [Pragmatic Thinking and Learning](https://pragprog.com/book/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning)
book, where it explains gracefully and simply how different models of
coaching/managing are necessary depending on the group of people
you are dealing.

More unexperienced people will need more guidance and management,
experienced people need freedom. Doing the contrary result on trying to
race sheep (not gonna happen) or herding horses (also not gonna happen).

Besides experience there is another very fundamental concept, motivation.
Because of the self-motivated threshold the ARPA/PARC run with
no control at all:

```
Thus conventional oversight was not only not
needed, but was not really possible. "Peer review" wasn't easily
done even with actual peers. The situation was "out of control",
yet extremely productive and not at all anarchic.
```

There is no way to argue that this period was not extremely productive,
the mouse that I'm using right now is a product of this work.
But it is important to understand the pre-requisites to enable this
kind of management and productivity. There is another great talk from
Alan Kay that talks more about abilities distribution in human beings
(among other cool stuff), it is called
[Normal Considered Harmful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvmTSpJU-Xc).

Building this context of right people with self-motivation is hard, that is
why generally management is not done this way, and it is right on not doing
it (it would fail with the wrong audience), from the text:

```
Because of the normal
distribution of talents and drive in the world, a depressingly large
percentage of organizational processes have been designed to
deal with people of moderate ability, motivation, and trust. We
can easily see this in most walks of life today, but also
astoundingly in corporate, university, and government research.
```

It is important to understand which is your context when you are
managing software development, there is no silver bullet on
management either.

A good advice is also found on the text for managers. Humans in general
have a problem with uncertainty and lack of control, which results in:

```
in most processes today—and sadly in most important areas of
technology research—the administrators seem to prefer to be
completely in control of mediocre processes to being "out of
control" with superproductive processes. They are trying to
"avoid failure" rather than trying to "capture the heavens". 
```

The human mind always falls easily on the sweet illusion of control =).
About the avoiding error part, another cool example:

```
Our game is more like art and sports than accounting, in that
high percentages of failure are quite OK as long as enough larger
processes succeed. Ty Cobb's lifetime batting average was
"only" .368, which means that he failed almost 2/3s of the time.
But the critical question is: what happened in the 1/3 in which he
was succeeding? If the answer is "great things" then this is all the
justification that should be needed.
```

How the rest of the Xerox management saw this ?

```
Xerox often was
shocked at the PARC process and declared it out of control, but
they didn't understand that the context was so powerful and
compelling and the good will so abundant, that the artists worked
happily at their version of the vision. The results were an
enormous collection of breakthroughs, some of which we are
celebrating today
```

This cuts both ways, some areas of Xerox where benefiting from
a more control oriented management, the error is to not identify
different contexts and apply the better management techniques
to each one of them.

Another thing that caught my attention was how realistic they
where with their limitations, even having a brilliant group of people

```
but the attitude from the beginning combined both big
ideas and projects, with a large amount of respect for how
complexity can grow faster than IQs.
```

Which reminds me of the [The Humble Programmer](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html)
article. There is no software design principle that I know that can't be boiled
down to the fact that our feeble intellects have a lot of problems
on grasping complexity on problems. I won't elaborate more on this
principle, but it is a great one and it is really cool to see it being
applied on such a cool context.

Coming back to managing stuff. Being "out of control" does not mean no
managing at all (do not toss your manager out of the window yet).
There is a brilliant guideline on how to "manage" an environment like
this one:

```
I remember Butler, in his
first few weeks at PARC, arguing as only he could that he was
tired of bubble-gummed !@#$%^&* fragile research systems that
could barely be demoed by their creators. He called for two
general principles: that we should not make anything that was
not engineered for 100 users, and we should all have to use our
creations as our main computing systems (later called Living
Lab).
```

There you go, put some cool constraints and great things can happen.
Today we call this "dogfooding" from the "eat your own dog food", meaning
"use your own systems". Again we can see that a lot of our "cool trending ideas"
are cool but not new at all, our ignorance about our own past and the
brilliance of the people that built what we use today is what makes us
think that we are developing new cool ideas when we are just refurbishing
old ones (almost all the time poorly and without understanding why we do it).

The idea of what happened at ARPA/PARC is different from tossing around
a lot of money on a lot of people without expecting nothing. People who
are self motivated usually like to finish stuff and see them working, and
the principle of using its own creation catalysed this even more. The resources
where scarce and this generated a finesse on how work was realized:

```
Respect for complexity, lack of knowledge, the small number of
researchers and modest budgets at PARC led to a finessing style
of design. Instead of trying to build the complex artifacts from
scratch—like trying to build living things cell by cell—many of
the most important projects built a kernel that could grow the
artifact as new knowledge was gained—that is: get one cell’s
DNA in good shape and let it help grow the whole system. 
```

Which again reminds of some "new" stuff like minimal viable product,
deliver every week, etc. At the same time that the article does not
mention "estimation" once, you can see a great deal of energy spent
by people to always have functional systems being delivered and
experimented with.

I like comparing software development with biology instead of buildings
because a lot of principles that are applied in nature make a lot of
sense in software. One of them is to avoid perfection:

```
The difference between having to make a perfect
artifact and one that can eventually do something perfectly is
enormous. 
```

There is no greater example of this idea than life itself, at least to me.
Perhaps if nature was trying to be perfect we would still be cells, or even less,
just "imperfect" proteins floating around on water.

In the end the "out-of-control" management was highly focused on delivering
working stuff that was used by their own creators, and complexity
and perfection where avoided.

## Building your own tools

This is a very interesting subject that is also covered by the article.
