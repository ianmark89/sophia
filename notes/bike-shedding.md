# Bike Shedding

I never knew exactly why people used the expression
**bike shedding** to refer to stupid discussions.

Some article (dont remember it anymore) tells the origin of this expression,
it is a psychological fact about humans, the more important a decision
is people will tend to discuss stupid details instead of discussing
the real serious issues that actually have to be addressed.

The bike shed story is a reference to this phenomenon, a group
of engineers where responsible to building a nuclear power
plant. Instead of discussing real design decisions they spent more
than a month just discussing where and how the bike shed of the
power plant would be built. That is the origin of the 
**bike shedding** expression.
