# Alan Kay Cool Stuff

## Science definition

Greatest thought process ever created by humankind exactly
because it does not is about "truth". There is reality and there is
our limited brains and how can they represent reality. Science is about
building N representations of the reality, all of them are false on some
sense since our brains are very limited, and realising that and exploring
this representation space is a very powerful concept.

To be able to see you have to realise you are actually blind.

## Mind as canyons

This metaphor compares our view of reality as canyons that are formed by erosion.
As time passes they only get deeper and it gets really hard to see out of them.

## First human powered flight

McReady was the first man to implement successfully human powered flight.
What is cool on the history is how he was able to do that, basically two things:

* He was not trying to build a plane, he was trying do to human powered flight
* He found a way to get feedback fast

The fast feedback is key, everyone expended months rebuilding the planes after a
failure. He built a VERY simple prototype, rebuilding and hacking it was pretty fast.

With this process of "try, fail, correct, try again" he was able to get it working in
six months (some of the planes took almost this just to be built).

## Burma monkeys

Monkeys at Burma are captured by putting a nut inside a jar. When the monkey
grabs the nut it can't take its hand from the jar. The monkeys could get free
at any time just by releasing the nut, almost none of them do this, they get
caught because of their inability of letting go. This is a human trait as well,
since we are primates :-).

Sometimes to get something you need to let it go.

## Catch phrases

* It is big meaning, not big data
