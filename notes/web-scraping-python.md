# Web Scraping in Python

## Ideas

* BeautifulSoup is your friend :-)
* Natural language processing N grammar thing, pretty cool
* The way markov chains are used on page rank is interesting (modelling probability of users navigation through links)
* NTLK can help determining if a word is used as a noun or a verb (can be useful sometimes)
* Watch out with hidden stuff that is necessary on forms (parse the form and get all stuff)
* Watch out for hidden stuff that is actually honeypots


## Tools

* [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/)
* [pillow](http://python-pillow.org/)
* [tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr)
