# The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined

This book provides an interesting view on a subject that usually is
treated as a certainty, that violence is going from bad to worse.

It seems counter intuitive that violence is declining since we live so
near the century where we had the first two world wars, but the author
makes a very good point on showing that the way almost all societies
see violence has indeed changed, even the perception that we have of
the two world wars show differences on the human psychology today that
may indicate that violence will decline even further.

I'm not a very positive person and I'm not very fond to the idea that
human beings are good. But neither does the author, quoting from him:

```
We are not inherently bad nor inherently good
```

We just want to survive, and with the exceptions of psychopaths and
some outliers, usually violence is a means to get to an end, not the
end itself. Pretty much on the beginning of the book he tries to argue
that we don't need violence, he calls that a "hydraulic model" of how
violence works, like when we are not being violent this violence piles
up inside of us and we need to let it out.

Proving anything that is related to human behavior is almost impossible
to me, there is always an outlier or some doubt that you can raise on
why people do what they do. But he makes a lot of good points involving
the practical reasons to use violence and the difference on the use of
violence when people are exposed to different exogenous forces.

This is one of the basis of the book and it makes sense to me, the idea
that exogenous forces changes our behavior in a great deal, something like
"we are shaped by our environment".

Along the book there is a plethora of statistics and information regarding
how violence is lower today than was in the past. A lot of things are pretty
surprising, but it makes sense to see the past as a very violent place, specially
if you take a look on the instruments used for torture on medieval times.
And is not just torture, the way violence was used on entertainment is
astonishing, we have similar things on movies but people usually are
appalled by real violence, in older times violence and death where much
more acceptable, specially because they where accepted as normal and
welcomed by the society (think about people gathering on a town square
to stone someone).

His point is that civilization is a force that promotes less violence
than more violence as much people believe, like in the old days people
where more pacific and wars like the two world wars are an artifact
built from our new civilization era. To be honest that doesn't make
any sense to me since war was always a part of the human history, just
the tools to fight it changed. The important aspect to note is the
reaction of us human beings as a society to it, comparing to how it
was seen on the past.

But the core idea is, we are not bad or good, we just want to live
our lives well. There are different ways that we can do that as a
community, some of them can propel us to use more violence, others
don't, simply because it is more advantageous to not use violence.

This was a very interesting aspect of the book to me, because it is
not about morality or how human beings are good and caring. It just
explores how civilization is a way to live in communities that catalyzes
other human traits, as empathy, instead of direct aggression. But it
does so on a total selfish way, people don't abandon violence because
it is morally wrong, they do it when it is better to them, when it improves
their chance of surviving.

Some people do abandon violence for moral reasons, but I don't believe
that is a good basis for changes on the scale discussed on the book (entire
societies). To a change to be observed on an entire country it has to
have some practical reasons behind it.

The book is pretty long but I will try to create a mental model of
what are the exogenous forces that can help humans be less violent
and more collaborative. Empiric evidence of my own life shows that
people can excel at both, it makes sense that environmental factors
can push you on one direction or another.

# Exogenous Forces

## Leviathan

## Trading

## Accessible Knowledge

# Life is Sacred

Talk about the change in perspective of the value of individual human life.

Also how the idea of an eternal afterlife can make your current life mean less.

# Utopy and Genocide

It is funny to see these two words together but the book presents a pretty
good case on how utopies can be an deep influence for genocides. It is far
from being the only reason for genocide, sometimes the reason is just that
you want the resources that are monopolized by another group of people.
But the are two ways that utopies can make genocide seems like an acceptable idea.

The first one is related to the nature of utopies, being about attaining undescriptable
happyness and prosperity, for ages or even forever. When faced with this prospect
what is the death of one million humans when you guaranteeing the forever happyness
and well being of one hundred million ? Killing may not look fun, but at least it
seems feasible for the greater good (the catch is that there is no such greater good).

The second one is that utopies usually are also about peace and harmony, for that to
happen there is no space for dissidents and people that think differently. The solution ?
Out with the people that think different =). It is an enforcement of uniformity. Uniformity
and consistent are desirable (that is why people segregate), trying to take it to
the level of an utopic society will lead to expulsion or killing of the groups of
people who do not conform. This is the only way that you can guarantee that 
conflicts will NEVER happen.

It is appalling that a book takes as sacred (the bible) preaches exactly these
ideas. The only way to not read these ideas on the bible is to
EXTREMELLY compartmentalize =/. But it also enforces the idea that it is an old book
written by people, people are filled with utopies and prejudice. Now we see some improvement
on this kind of thought, but its pervasiveness on the human society explains a lot
about our "sacred" books.

The most obvious and recent example of this kind of utopic bible based thinking is
nazism. Even the third reich having a duration of thousand years is an obvious reference
to the bible. It is important to identify this kind of thinking as an exogenous force
for violence so we can just eliminate it from our societies. There is no utopy, there is
just life, and thinking like that can lead to much more respect and prosperity than
believing in pipe dreams.

# Animal Rights

There is a great deal of information on the rights movement, that encompasses
women, gays and other minorities rights. It is very easy to see a correlation
on minorities gaining voice and space and the decrease on violent behavior,
this sort of behavior would usually be solved with violence in the past yet in
modern democracies they get traction specially because a democratic government
has a monopoly on violence but can't use at will since it is accountable
to the citizens.

There is a lot of cool information on how animal rights evolved over time but
the thing that got my attention is the correlation to stupid/outdated
religion/spirituality to how we treat animals. It is offensive to a lot
of people to say something like that, but as a former Christian myself
I'm compelled to believe that we do need spirituality (perhaps this is
not even the best word for it) but there are terrible ways to achieve
spiritual satisfaction.

The core basis of Christian and Judaic believe, at least according to the
holy bible, is that humans are something special separated from the rest
of the animals, made as the image of god, and the rest of all the earth
was made for humans to dominate. This is a recurrent subject in the entire
bible, but on its very beginning it is very explicit. Genesis 1:26 make
this explicitly clear:

```
And God went on to say: â€œLet us make man in our image,
according to our likeness, and let them have in subjection the fish
of the sea and the flying creatures of the heavens and the domestic
animals and all the earth and every moving animal that is moving
upon the earth.
```

Analyzing written material from older ages on how animals are treated
(and why they were treated the way they were) it is very clear that
it is connected with this idea that men can do anything with earth
because the earth simply belong to them.

Another interesting psychological artifact from primitive religion is
the idea that we have an immortal soul that grants us conscience and
sentience, which by definition animals do not have, ergo they are
not sentient. If they don't feel anything and are not
sentient then you can do whatever you want with them, pretty much
as you would do with vegetables.

It is interesting that some people think that not believing in
god and this kind of stuff will make you behave like a mindless husk
that only wants pleasure and satisfaction.

Actually thinking that you evolved from simple primates opens up
the path to feeling empathy for the animals, simply because we are
not that different or special.

Another implication of a more evolutionary mindset is that conscience
is not a binary trait, it is not something that humans
on all their glory have and other animals have none, it is an spectrum.

The idea of a spectrum makes a lot of questions harder to answer.
Since it is not binary, where is the line ?
Is it okay to eat fish ? slugs ? insects ? How much neurological power
is required to have enough conscience and sentience ? What would be
"enough conscience" ? How to measure that ? Drawing a line gets
much harder specially because the sets are fuzzy now, not crispy.

As usual this approach takes to inquiry and exploration and to make
us think twice on how we treat other living beings, while the more
primitive religious beliefs simplifies the model and legalizes
stupid behavior (not even going in the women's right VS the bible
because that would be too easy).

In the end, nothing against the idea of spirituality and religion,
just against primitive/stupid ones.
It seems offensive to talk like that, but some beliefs do much
more harm to us than good and that must be acknowledged and criticized.
This intellectual ability to be empathetic with other living beings
and to criticize and compare ideas is a great force deterring violence
in our society today. At least it seems to me and to the author.
