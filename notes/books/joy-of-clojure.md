# Pros

* Interesting de-structuring facilities
* Arity based pattern matching (not as awesome as full value pattern matching)
* Some of the elegance of Lisp (uniformity and simplicity of composing functions)

# Cons

* Java / JVM gigantic stack traces
* Algorithms implemented using Java crappy stuff :-( (like sorting)
* Some of the syntax starts to seen bloated, Java like culture ([example](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/-%3E))
