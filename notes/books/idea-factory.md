# The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation

## Angels and Demons

On the first chapter of the book, which introduces the personal history
of some of the key people inside bell labs, the thing that caught more
my attention is the AT&T company, which developed the Bell Labs later.

I was kind surprised to read that AT&T was extremely litigious/aggressive
on its business practice. It was not uncommon from AT&T to sabotage competitors
directly, like breaking stuff, or indirectly by buying out materials
from providers to starve other companies.

Well, this began a phase of introspection in my mind...why was I surprised ?
I was surprised because of this indoctrination that we have on our society
that shows people and entities as angels or demons, and everyone must be good,
good things only comes from well intentioned good people, etc. Which is a pile
of rubbish (although it is still engraved on my conscience
by years of indoctrination, or my own naivety).

Rubbish is a strong word, but it does fit well in this case because on the
history of the Bell Labs there was no change of hearth on the objectives
of AT&T, only a change on management. The change of management happened
around 1910 (I'm lousy with dates and names). The new management still
wanted to consolidate AT&T as a monopoly, he just have a better view
on how achieve it. So there it is, a lot of the greatest inventions
of the twentieth century where made to consolidate a monopoly. And they
where great on a scale that we have yet not reproduced (even Google).

This gave me a lot of food for thought. Greatness and innovation being
achieved by a company just trying to dominate the entire world communication.
It is a fact also that the people who actually developed the ideas where
not interested on monopolies or world domination, but it is interesting to
observe this symbiosis of business/power ambition and creative ambition.
Also it makes me think on how lame the Google's motto of "Don't be Evil"
is naive and moronic. Actually is naive to the employee's who actually
believe that, the actual people running the company are pretty aware
that this is a very naive way to see life. It is like thinking that the
lion is bad because it kills other "innocent" animals.

AT&T was much more honest on how it behaves. It wants to have absolute
power and dominance of its market. They where pretty straightforward
with it. Monopolies are not great for the users, but at least AT&T was
honest on its desire to achieve it, Google is not, it tries to sell
something that they aren't.

Going back to Bell Labs, around 1910 there was the change of management
and a vision has emerged with it:

```
One policy, one system, universal service
```

Well, if your naive part is thinking that they embraced the idea of
working with other companies to build a universal service and live
happily after, you will be terribly wrong =).

The vision of oneness is based on everything belonging to AT&T.
They started to buy other companies, and when the government was
worried they started to allow the other companies to use their 
system for a fee, which was better than before where AT&T NEVER
provided any kind of integration. Before people usually needed
3 phones because AT&T would now allow any other phone company
to integrate on their system.

The objective of dominance had not changed, but the means had,
when buying was not possible allowing integration seemed better
than the previous extremely aggressive strategy. But the final goal
was still dominance, not being good.

Here is where things start to get interesting. In 1909 there was the
plan to do the first intercontinental phone call, from New York to
San Francisco. It was an extremely ambitious plan, no one had
a clue on how to make such kind of long distance call.
It was a vision, the vision of universal service, that was driving this.

This is the start of the idea of investing on research and science
to truly disrupt and innovate, do what no other have did, and not because
of lack of imagination but because it seemed physically impossible to be done.

The desire of monopoly was still there, but at least the vision on
how to achieve it involved greatness, dominance though cheer capacity
to do the impossible, to have the better minds of the world on its side
(pretty different from Microsoft's monopoly for example).

Fuelled by this vision and a ambitious goal to do what has never
been done before the labs started to be built. Not officially, but
the idea to hire scientists and researchers started to be put on
practice and a new symbiosis started to emerge. AT&T started to be
moved by research done by a few and a lot of other engineering
effort that required a lot of people, that was essential too, but
was a very different work on its nature.

On this case it is better to quote the book itself:

```
Theodore Vail's long term vision for the company - to look
beyond the day-to-day concerns that shaped the work of their
fellow engineers (to think five or ten years ahead was admirable)
and focus on how fundamental questions of physics or chemistry
might someday affect communications
```

Besides have a clear notion that both where required, the management
part of the company where also aware of the difference on how
to manage each part:

```
Inventions are a valuable part, but invention is not to be
scheduled or coerced.
```
```
His point was that genius would undoubtedly improve the
company's operations just as ordinary engineering could.
But genius was not predictable. You had to give it room
to assert itself
```

The nature of research work makes it very sensible to how
you select the people to do it. It is a work where passion
about what is done is essential, since it may take years
to get tangible results the best way to be sure that
people are actually working is the fact that they would
be doing it anyway even if they where not being paid to do so.

It is interesting to meditate of the difference of motivations
of the management and the researchers, yet in the end both
wanted the same end, to create something unique and change
human life forever (nothing has done that as well as ubiquitous
communication).

In the end they where able to do the transcontinental phone call,
the problem of amplifying the electrical signal of the call was
solved using a vacuum tube, which would be used on the future
for very different things (like computing).

Like this starts the story of great inventions that leveraged
humanity with the objective of total domination of communication
from a single company, indeed food for thought =).

## The Secret of Innovation

As the labs started to produce great ideas the management of the labs
started to think on what was the recipe for that. It makes sense
since everytime something produces good results you want to discover
how to reproduce it as many times as you want. Of course that when the
subject is human beings and their interactions in the development of
new ideas this is MUCH harder than a simple scientific experiment =).

Even a simple question like, "what is the most important, group effort
or the smart individuals ?" was not easy to answer. Why is that ?
Well on one hand you have the invention of the transistor, which was an
obvious group effort since it took collaboration between physics and
chemistry. On the other hand you have the born of information theory,
which was pretty much an individual effort. Claude Shannon basically
laid the foundation of digital information, all by himself, people that
worked with him had no idea from where he has gotten the ideas.

So both things seems to work, depending on the problem at hand. The only
constant is the need of smart people =P, and the groups where not very
large. The labs where pretty large but they worked on different projects.
On the transistor no more than 10 people were involved.

Another very interesting find when a survey was done to find why some researches
had more patents than others was that almost all the researchers with
a lot of patents seemed to have lunch or breakfast with Harry Nyquist.

This seems odd at first glance, but I myself had pretty interesting lunches
discussing stuff with smart people. Even small things like people talking
on a meal can make all the difference. People that used to do this with
Nyquist said that he had a gift of asking the right questions and pushing
them on interesting directions. Small things like this makes a huge difference
and they are not manageable (in the management sense =P) nor they can
be inforced as a process. These things just happens when people interested
on the same topics are together and have the freedom to talk with each other.

This went much further than just lunching at Bell Labs. Everyone at the labs
had the autonomy to stop what he/she was doing and starting to work with
someone else on another project if that made sense. This kind of cross team
collaboration had a 0% of management overhead, you did not have to ask anyone
to help another team with something (that was encouraged). One thing that
is obvious is that people with deadlines will never do this, that is why
on the labs there was no such a thing (and yet people delivered).

One example of a invention that come up with something like this was the
solar cell baterry. The four people involved on its invention where each
from a different team, and they where not trying to invent a solar cell
battery, it was a different solid state experiment that in the end
showed the necessary properties for a solar cell battery.

It is obvious that this would not work with any group of people, you need
people that are driven by curiosity, that would do the research
anyway even if they where not paid to do it (this has an interesting connection
with the ideas presented at [The Power Of Context](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2004001_power.pdf) ).

It is also obvious that this group of people are not well fit to do operational
day to day work, which was handled by a different group of people, with different
qualities and a different management model.

Another thing that is very explict is how even very smart people that
had some great ideas before can be very wrong too. Like when Mervin Kelly
veted the development of satellites, even though he promoted the development
of the transistor before.

## Inventions are used/composed on unforeseen ways

The most traditional example of this is the transistor and information theory.
The transistor was developed as a substitute of the vacuum tube, that was
used as an amplifier for long distance calls.

At the same time Claude Shannon was writing a theory modeling communication mathematically and
he had no idea that his theory was going to be used with transistor to build the
digital age, and the people involved on the transistor had no idea of the
digital information theory of Claude Shannon. Today the connection between the two
are obvious, but at that time it wasn't. Yet both researches where nurtured on the labs.

Investing on researches that at first seemed completely unrelated produced great results
at the lab, even with a high failure rate. Not all companies have money to do this kind
of investiment, but the ones that do have the money can benefit greatly from these examples.
And smaller companies can do similar investments on a smaller scale (not on the startup
stage, probably).

## Speed of information as speed of thought

As the book approaches the end it starts to compare that long gone age
of bell labs breakthroughs with the world we live today. I don't remember
exactly who used to say this at bell labs, but it was about tradeoffs, the
fact that all technology that we invent has some drawback on our life.

Information today is given to us with a much greater throughput than we can
process and the book mentions a journalist, Nicholas Carr, that thinks that
the constant flow of new information is eroding our capacity to concentrate
and to think deeply. It is like we expected ideas to flow on our brains as
fast as data is delivered to us, and all ideas must fit a quarter. We are lousing
touch with the fact that some things takes time to develop inside our minds, not
everything should fit as a deliverable in a sprint.

Since I feel this a lot these days I found it very interesting that more people
feel the same. It is interesting that someone else on the book (again...terrible
with names) made a prediction that the next great thing in technology will be something
that makes it easier to extract truly useful insights from the deluge of data
we have today, like cognitive augmentation, since we are clearly overwhelmed.

## Different kinds of innovation

As we reflect comparing those days where transistors where being researched with
today it is clear that we have two kinds of innovation. There is consumer products
innovation (like Netflix and Spotify) and there is innovation that represents a leap
on human knowledge, these leaps are able to create whole new industries, they work
as platforms not as final products. Some examples of these innovations:

* Vacuum Tubes
* Information Theory
* Transistors
* Microwave
* Radar
* Satellites
* Cellular

None of these where end products, but they are the base who forms our society today.
One interesting question posed is if our current model of development is being able to
innovate on products and also in this type of technological platforms or are we just
living of the dividends of the research done on the last century for us.

There is a whole line of questioning on the book that is very interesting, on how
venture capital works today and the silicon valley model of developing new technologies,
which with no surprise it is also a tradeoff when compared with what we had at
the bell labs period.

It is definitely easier to get capital to start a business today, specially if it is
related to software, but at the same time comparing what the big tech companies are
doing with AT&T have done on the last century and they are dwarfed by it. Not that they
don't do anything, but Bell Labs did too much more. We are never going to have the
exact same context that Bell Labs had, but it is interesting to see what made it
succeed and see if there is something that can be learned and applied from it.

## Innovation and Competition

It is common sense that competition is better for the end consumer than
a monopoly (I also think that), what is interesting is that we lack criticism
on where this model will fail. It makes sense to think that innovation will arise
because if you don't innovate you day, so everything will work out and innovation
will appear.

The problem with this model is that it works great for consumer product innovations,
but poorly for research of groundbreaking technology. The more agressive the market
the harder it will be to do research that takes time, and thinking that great things
can be done fast is just an illusion of our era, humans minds do not evolve that fast,
we still take a lot of time to have REALLY good ideas, specially the ones that questions
the way that we do everything. Information theory, at the time, took almost two decades
to be properly understood, we still are the same human beings and having more information
do not change that, because it won't change our ability to unlearn things and rethink
things.

Since this kind of research takes time, like five or more years, almost no company will try
something like that, and the idea that incrementally you can get in the same place is an
illusion. Again for consumer products this is great, you can get every month slight better
Netflix service. For technological leaps, no (hence the "leap"). For example, there
was no amount of incremental improvement on copper wiring that would get you to glass
fiber. Also there would be no incremental steps to going from vacuum tubes to transistors.
Another example is thinking about incremental innovations on transistor construction taking us
to quantum computing, it simply won't.

The idea is not to be against incremental change, but to be against *ONLY* incremental change.
Today you only read about incremental stuff, and delivering fast, this is great for a lot of
things, but not for all things, and the book does a great job on showing the world a little
more gray than black and white. Not just with the incremental thing that is essential to competition,
but also with competition itself, is it the better way to achieve these great technological breakthroughs ?

In the case of Bell Labs there was a great deal of collaboration with Universities and even
other companies (not that they collaborated on EVERYTHING, but much more than we are used to).
Why would a company collaborate on technologies that would be fundamental to its market on
the future ? Would that not be a risk ? Well, not for a state regulated monopoly. AT&T had
no reason to hold back on collaboration and to invest years on research because that research
could not be used against them on the future. This safety fostered collaboration on the labs
instead of fierce competition, and it produced basically the foundation for our century.

It does not mean that it is a golden model that will solve everything, but it also shows that
competition is not the only way to get innovation. And the fierce capitalist view of venture
capital can't seem to nurture the kind of research that was done at Bell Labs, one quote
from some dude from venture capital that I again can't remember the name said that "we don't
invest on scientific experiments". There is a current detriment of scientific experiments,
although it was them that took us where we are today =/.

Investments are too shortsighted to produce any real change on the technological landscape.
Aggressive capitalism does not seem to be enough although we can get a lot done with it.
The chances of regulated monopolies coming back are slim, even because they usually dont
work as well as bell labs worked.

So this brings the question of how we are going to fund the future (or even if we are going to do it).
Pure government funding providing grants to research at universities do not seem to produce the same
results either. Bell Labs was able to provide a mix of people that where academic with
other people that where not, this mix provided unique results. There is a lot of talent (most of it probably)
that is attracted to the industry, it would be interesting to leverage more of that talent to do
the kind of long term research that was made at Bell Labs. But the forces that acted to allow
Bell Labs to work like that are long gone (the regulated monopoly that enforced all patents to
be public but not free, althought not expensive either...anyway it was regulated =P).

In some sense I think this was the most amazing thing that Bell Labs ever created, it was this model
of work that coalesced engineering, applied research and base research. They simply had all kinds of
people working together. There where academics, but there was also engineers that had the knowledge
to take ideas further close to becoming a reality. Some people where great at having ideas, others where
great at doing experimentation, and they worked really well together. They where the pioneers of proving
that even base research was a fundamental piece of industry, not some kind of academic effort that
should be left to universities. This change was what started CIRCA 1910, when Bell Labs was started
to be built, siphoning all kinds of talent from universities and amalgamating that with great
industrial engineers (at that time there was a clear division between engineers and researchers, and
the industry was no place for research). This vision and model of work may in the end be the most
important legacy left to us, because above all technological advancements they gave us
we need good ideas on how to build the future...again =).
