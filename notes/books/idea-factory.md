# The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation

## Angels and Demons

On the first chapter of the book, which introduces the personal history
of some of the key people inside bell labs, the thing that caught more
my attention is the AT&T company, which developed the Bell Labs later.

I was kind surprised to read that AT&T was extremely litigious/aggressive
on its business practice. It was not uncommon from AT&T to sabotage competitors
directly, like breaking stuff, or indirectly by buying out materials
from providers to starve other companies.

Well, this began a phase of introspection in my mind...why was I surprised ?
I was surprised because of this indoctrination that we have on our society
that shows people and entities as angels or demons, and everyone must be good,
good things only comes from well intentioned good people, etc. Which is a pile
of rubbish (although it is still engraved on my conscience
by years of indoctrination, or my own naivety).

Rubbish is a strong word, but it does fit well in this case because on the
history of the Bell Labs there was no change of hearth on the objectives
of AT&T, only a change on management. The change of management happened
around 1910 (I'm lousy with dates and names). The new management still
wanted to consolidate AT&T as a monopoly, he just have a better view
on how achieve it. So there it is, a lot of the greatest inventions
of the twentieth century where made to consolidate a monopoly. And they
where great on a scale that we have yet not reproduced (even Google).

This gave me a lot of food for thought. Greatness and innovation being
achieved by a company just trying to dominate the entire world communication.
It is a fact also that the people who actually developed the ideas where
not interested on monopolies or world domination, but it is interesting to
observe this symbiosis of business/power ambition and creative ambition.
Also it makes me think on how lame the Google's motto of "Don't be Evil"
is naive and moronic. Actually is naive to the employee's who actually
believe that, the actual people running the company are pretty aware
that this is a very naive way to see life. It is like thinking that the
lion is bad because it kills other "innocent" animals.

AT&T was much more honest on how it behaves. It wants to have absolute
power and dominance of its market. They where pretty straightforward
with it. Monopolies are not great for the users, but at least AT&T was
honest on its desire to achieve it, Google is not, it tries to sell
something that they aren't.

Going back to Bell Labs, around 1910 there was the change of management
and a vision has emerged with it:

```
One policy, one system, universal service
```

Well, if your naive part is thinking that they embraced the idea of
working with other companies to build a universal service and live
happily after, you will be terribly wrong =).

The vision of oneness is based on everything belonging to AT&T.
They started to buy other companies, and when the government was
worried they started to allow the other companies to use their 
system for a fee, which was better than before where AT&T NEVER
provided any kind of integration. Before people usually needed
3 phones because AT&T would now allow any other phone company
to integrate on their system.

The objective of dominance had not changed, but the means had,
when buying was not possible allowing integration seemed better
than the previous extremely aggressive strategy. But the final goal
was still dominance, not being good.

Here is where things start to get interesting. In 1909 there was the
plan to do the first intercontinental phone call, from New York to
San Francisco. It was an extremely ambitious plan, no one had
a clue on how to make such kind of long distance call.
It was a vision, the vision of universal service, that was driving this.

This is the start of the idea of investing on research and science
to truly disrupt and innovate, do what no other have did, and not because
of lack of imagination but because it seemed physically impossible to be done.

The desire of monopoly was still there, but at least the vision on
how to achieve it involved greatness, dominance though cheer capacity
to do the impossible, to have the better minds of the world on its side
(pretty different from Microsoft's monopoly for example).

Fuelled by this vision and a ambitious goal to do what has never
been done before the labs started to be built. Not officially, but
the idea to hire scientists and researchers started to be put on
practice and a new symbiosis started to emerge. AT&T started to be
moved by research done by a few and a lot of other engineering
effort that required a lot of people, that was essential too, but
was a very different work on its nature.

On this case it is better to quote the book itself:

```
Theodore Vail's long term vision for the company - to look
beyond the day-to-day concerns that shaped the work of their
fellow engineers (to think five or ten years ahead was admirable)
and focus on how fundamental questions of physics or chemistry
might someday affect communications
```

Besides have a clear notion that both where required, the management
part of the company where also aware of the difference on how
to manage each part:

```
Inventions are a valuable part, but invention is not to be
scheduled or coerced.
```
```
His point was that genius would undoubtedly improve the
company's operations just as ordinary engineering could.
But genius was not predictable. You had to give it room
to assert itself
```

The nature of research work makes it very sensible to how
you select the people to do it. It is a work where passion
about what is done is essential, since it may take years
to get tangible results the best way to be sure that
people are actually working is the fact that they would
be doing it anyway even if they where not being paid to do so.

It is interesting to meditate of the difference of motivations
of the management and the researchers, yet in the end bot
wanted the same end, to create something unique and change
human life forever (nothing has done that as well as ubiquitous
communication).

In the end they where able to do the transcontinental phone call,
the problem of amplifying the electrical signal of the call was
solved using a vacuum tube, which would be used on the future
for very different things (like computing).

Like this starts the story of great inventions that leveraged
humanity with the objective of total domination of communication
from a single company, indeed food for thought =).
