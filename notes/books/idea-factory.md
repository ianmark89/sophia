# The Idea Factory: Bell Labs and the Great Age of American Innovation

## Angels and Demons

On the first chapter of the book, which introduces the personal history
of some of the key people inside bell labs, the thing that caught more
my attention is the AT&T company, which developed the Bell Labs later.

I was kind surprised to read that AT&T was extremely litigious/aggressive
on its business practice. It was not uncommon from AT&T to sabotage competitors
directly, like breaking stuff, or indirectly by buying out materials
from providers to starve other companies.

Well, this began a phase of introspection in my mind...why was I surprised ?
I was surprised because of this indoctrination that we have on our society
that shows people and entities as angels or demons, and everyone must be good,
good things only comes from well intentioned good people, etc. Which is a pile
of rubbish (although it is still engraved on my conscience
by years of indoctrination, or my own naivety).

Rubbish is a strong word, but it does fit well in this case because on the
history of the Bell Labs there was no change of hearth on the objectives
of AT&T, only a change on management. The change of management happened
around 1910 (I'm lousy with dates and names). The new management still
wanted to consolidate AT&T as a monopoly, he just have a better view
on how achieve it. So there it is, a lot of the greatest inventions
of the twentieth century where made to consolidate a monopoly. And they
where great on a scale that we have yet not reproduced (even Google).

This gave me a lot of food for thought. Greatness and innovation being
achieved by a company just trying to dominate the entire world communication.
It is a fact also that the people who actually developed the ideas where
not interested on monopolies or world domination, but it is interesting to
observe this symbiosis of business/power ambition and creative ambition.
Also it makes me think on how lame the Google's motto of "Don't be Evil"
is naive and moronic. Actually is naive to the employee's who actually
believe that, the actual people running the company are pretty aware
that this is a very naive way to see life. It is like thinking that the
lion is bad because it kills other "innocent" animals.

AT&T was much more honest on how it behaves. It wants to have absolute
power and dominance of its market. They where pretty straightforward
with it. Monopolies are not great for the users, but at least AT&T was
honest on its desire to achieve it, Google is not, it tries to sell
something that they aren't.

Going back to Bell Labs, around 1910 there was the change of management
and a vision has emerged with it:

```
One policy, one system, universal service
```

Well, if your naive part is thinking that they embraced the idea of
working with other companies to build a universal service and live
happily after, you will be terribly wrong =).

The vision of oneness is based on everything belonging to AT&T.
They started to buy other companies, and when the government was
worried they started to allow the other companies to use their 
system for a fee, which was better than before where AT&T NEVER
provided any kind of integration. Before people usually needed
3 phones because AT&T would now allow any other phone company
to integrate on their system.

The objective of dominance had not changed, but the means had,
when buying was not possible allowing integration seemed better
than the previous extremely aggressive strategy. But the final goal
was still dominance, not being good.

Here is where things start to get interesting. In 1909 there was the
plan to do the first intercontinental phone call, from New York to
San Francisco. It was an extremely ambitious plan, no one had
a clue on how to make such kind of long distance call.
It was a vision, the vision of universal service, that was driving this.

This is the start of the idea of investing on research and science
to truly disrupt and innovate, do what no other have did, and not because
of lack of imagination but because it seemed physically impossible to be done.

The desire of monopoly was still there, but at least the vision on
how to achieve it involved greatness, dominance though cheer capacity
to do the impossible, to have the better minds of the world on its side
(pretty different from Microsoft's monopoly for example).

Fuelled by this vision and a ambitious goal to do what has never
been done before the labs started to be built. Not officially, but
the idea to hire scientists and researchers started to be put on
practice and a new symbiosis started to emerge. AT&T started to be
moved by research done by a few and a lot of other engineering
effort that required a lot of people, that was essential too, but
was a very different work on its nature.

On this case it is better to quote the book itself:

```
Theodore Vail's long term vision for the company - to look
beyond the day-to-day concerns that shaped the work of their
fellow engineers (to think five or ten years ahead was admirable)
and focus on how fundamental questions of physics or chemistry
might someday affect communications
```

Besides have a clear notion that both where required, the management
part of the company where also aware of the difference on how
to manage each part:

```
Inventions are a valuable part, but invention is not to be
scheduled or coerced.
```
```
His point was that genius would undoubtedly improve the
company's operations just as ordinary engineering could.
But genius was not predictable. You had to give it room
to assert itself
```

The nature of research work makes it very sensible to how
you select the people to do it. It is a work where passion
about what is done is essential, since it may take years
to get tangible results the best way to be sure that
people are actually working is the fact that they would
be doing it anyway even if they where not being paid to do so.

It is interesting to meditate of the difference of motivations
of the management and the researchers, yet in the end bot
wanted the same end, to create something unique and change
human life forever (nothing has done that as well as ubiquitous
communication).

In the end they where able to do the transcontinental phone call,
the problem of amplifying the electrical signal of the call was
solved using a vacuum tube, which would be used on the future
for very different things (like computing).

Like this starts the story of great inventions that leveraged
humanity with the objective of total domination of communication
from a single company, indeed food for thought =).

## The Secret of Innovation

As the labs started to produce great ideas the management of the labs
started to think on what was the recipe for that. It makes sense
since everytime something produces good results you want to discover
how to reproduce it as many times as you want. Of course that when the
subject is human beings and their interactions in the development of
new ideas this is MUCH harder than a simple scientific experiment =).

Even a simple question like, "what is the most important, group effort
or the smart individuals ?" was not easy to answer. Why is that ?
Well on one hand you have the invention of the transistor, which was an
obvious group effort since it took collaboration between physics and
chemistry. On the other hand you have the born of information theory,
which was pretty much an individual effort. Claude Shannon basically
laid the foundation of digital information, all by himself, people that
worked with him had no idea from where he has gotten the ideas.

So both things seems to work, depending on the problem at hand. The only
constant is the need of smart people =P, and the groups where not very
large. The labs where pretty large but they worked on different projects.
On the transistor no more than 10 people were involved.

Another very interesting find when a survey was done to find why some researches
had more patents than others was that almost all the researchers with
a lot of patents seemed to have lunch or breakfast with Harry Nyquist.

This seems odd at first glance, but I myself had pretty interesting lunches
discussing stuff with smart people. Even small things like people talking
on a meal can make all the difference. People that used to do this with
Nyquist said that he had a gift of asking the right questions and pushing
them on interesting directions. Small things like this makes a huge difference
and they are not manageable (in the management sense =P) nor they can
be inforced as a process. These things just happens when people interested
on the same topics are together and have the freedom to talk with each other.

This went much further than just lunching at Bell Labs. Everyone at the labs
had the autonomy to stop what he/she was doing and starting to work with
someone else on another project if that made sense. This kind of cross team
collaboration had a 0% of management overhead, you did not have to ask anyone
to help another team with something (that was encouraged). One thing that
is obvious is that people with deadlines will never do this, that is why
on the labs there was no such a thing (and yet people delivered).

One example of a invention that come up with something like this was the
solar cell baterry. The four people involved on its invention where each
from a different team, and they where not trying to invent a solar cell
battery, it was a different solid state experiment that in the end
showed the necessary properties for a solar cell battery.

It is obvious that this would not work with any group of people, you need
people that are driven by curiosity, that would do the research
anyway even if they where not paid to do it (this has an interesting connection
with the ideas presented at [The Power Of Context](http://www.vpri.org/pdf/m2004001_power.pdf).

It is also obvious that this group of people are not well fit to do operational
day to day work, which was handled by a different group of people, with different
qualities and a different management model.

Another thing that is very explict is how even very smart people that
had some great ideas before can be very wrong too. Like when Mervin Kelly
veted the development of satellites, even though he promoted the development
of the transistor before.

## Inventions are used on unforeseen ways

The most traditional example of this is the transistor and information theory.
The transistor was developed as a substitute of the vacuum tube, that was
used as an amplifier for long distance calls.

At the same time Claude Shannon was writing a theory modeling communication mathematically.
He had no idea that his theory was going to be used with transistor to build the
digital age, and the people involved on the transistor had no idea of the
digital information theory of Claude Shannon. Today the connection between the two
are obvious, but at that time it wasn't. Yet both researches where nurtured on the labs.

Investing on researches that at first seemed completely unrelated produced great results
at the lab, even with a high failure rate. Not all companies have money to do this kind
of investiment, but the ones that do have the money can benefit greatly from these examples.
And smaller companies can do similar investments on a smaller scale (not on the startup
stage, probably).
