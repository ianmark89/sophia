# The Problem of Increasing Human Energy

The book starts with making a metaphor between humankind
and physics. The first premise that Tesla strives to prove
is that humankind is one thing. He uses a very sweet metaphor
saying that the pain that he feels when a friend is suffering
is the same that he feels when he himself is suffering, hence
there is no clear boundary between him and his friend and
they are part of the same whole.

This reminds me a lot of oriental philosophy and Alan Watts
The Book, the idea that we are part of a whole and the individual
is just a construction/model of our minds trying to figure things out.

Once you understand that we are part of the whole he builds on top
of that to create the physics metaphor. Humankind is a whole object
that is moving (even tough we don't know the direction correctly)
and the individuals would be individual atoms, they can add or subtract
from the movement, but they can't stop being part of it.

On this idea you can use the equation **e=mc^2** to understand
why the book is about energy. The idea is to increase human energy
(he does not explain why we should even try to do that...perhaps because
it is in our nature).

# Increase Mass

The first thing that he explores is increasing energy by increasing
mass, or in other words to avoid the loss of life. In this sense
he talks a lot about technological advancements both on water
treatment and on food crops, which are basic to sustain human life.

He does not go a lot on the idea that more people does not mean
necessarily people that will add to a good direction for humanity,
but it is interesting to read about a time were clean water was a
hard problem to solve, even tough some places still suffer from it
big cities in general solved the problem in a level that people
don't even think about it anymore (even tough the sustainability
of the solutions can be questioned).

He also talks a lot about loss of lives in wars and the
uselessness of it.

# Increase Speed

When talking about increasing speed he elaborates on how there are
3 types of people/particles in the humankind object. There are people
that are part of the movement, people that contributes only with attrition
(inertia) and retard movement and people who are going in a different
direction. The worst people to him are the ones that just produce attrition
because they just resist change and ideas but don't have any of their own.
People who have different ideas and put energy on them can at least be
dissuaded and can contribute to better ideas. People who just resist change
are harder to dissuade (if possible at all).

Now there is the question of what would be the correct direction. His opinion
is that the correct direction is reason and science. Which is not a surprise, and
even tough it may not be perfect it seems better than the previous human
directions of mysticisms and prejudice. One of the forces that contribute
to this direction is education, for example, it would be another good investment
to improve the energy of humankind.
