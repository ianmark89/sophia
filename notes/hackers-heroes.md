# Hackers, heroes of the computer revolution

This book is fucking awesome is so much ways that is even
hard to transcribe.

## What is a hack

First of all it goes right in the origin of the term hack.
So there is no more confusion on what is a hack, it is where the
term originated, people had a purpose with it, and it was magnificent.

It was basically anything that you worked on (not necessarily programming)
that you did just for the joy of being involved on the work, doing it pleased
you. The term was coined to differentiate from works that where related to
classes or to a job, that sometimes where constructive and useful, but
ultimately boring.

A hack was something that you enjoyed, was fun, and ultimately had to be
smart. A complete new way to look at a problem. An example of how useless the
problem could be is one of the first programs wrote by the first hackers at MIT
on the TX-0. A converter from Arabic numbers to roman. It was
extremely hard to implement a complete and correct one with the limitations
of the TX-0, and it was completely useless, no one ever used it.

The fun was in taking the challenge, solving it, and them trying to solve it
on a more clever way, using fewer instructions (called "bumming" the code).

The hackers never thought that information should be hidden, they where also
proficient lock breakers (physical ones). But they never stole anything, never
made money from it, it was the pure challenge that attracted them, and the
belief that information should be free.

Putting a wall or a lock, was the challenge, and the challenge had to be
tackled with clever solutions, but it was just that. This was done on the
spirit of free information flow, that always contributed to better solutions
since hackers could always improve on previous work from other hackers.

Hacking is pure greatness, it is bliss, love is a bigger motivator than duty,
and was love that was happening at the beginning of hacking.

There was no product, no royalties, no patents. Of course that this was funded
by DARPA, later the real world clashed with hacking. But before going into that.

## The Right Way

This is one of the ideas that struck me more. There was a pursuit for the best
solution to problems that was beautiful and fun. Even when you worked on top
of someone solution, was to make it better, or even roll-out your own new solution.

There was no idea of just using stuff to build products faster. An example is
when they received a new PDP-1 computer and just rewrote all the utilities programs
since the ones that came with the computer where not good enough, they where
not done the "right way".

People today think it is wrong to think that there is a right way, because it
implies a wrong one, and they avoid conflict.

These early hackers thrived on conflicts, it was not about ego's, they just cared.
They would discuss for hours subjects that seemed like a utterly time loss.
This immediately reminded me of my dynamic with one of my greatest friends,
he is as hacker as hackers can get, it really make me realize that I was
missing that in my life.

I convinced myself that I was not being pragmatic and not generating value,
but to be honest, in my hearth, the feeling that moves me is "fuck value, this
is fun". Conciliating this with making a living is necessary, but I inverted
the priority of these things in my life and I got in trouble because of that.

## Homebrew Computer Club

After the first batch of MIT hackers there was a second batch that
where more hardware hackers. This made sense since there was no computer
available to people yet, so they needed to build their own, this is as
hacker as it gets, building your own tools.

The first official personal computer was the Altair, based on the Intel
8080 CPU. It was about that time that the homebrew computer club emerged,
a place where hackers would share absolutely everything, even industrial
secrets. The hacker ethic was still in place with great energy. The club had
just a few hundreds of people in the end, something like 200.

One of the greatest forces behind the first personal computers where
the ideas from the sixties, empowering people, decentralization and
mistrust authorities. It seemed urgent to give people control of machines,
instead of leaving them at the hands of the industry, represented by IBM,
where only "priests" would be able to program computers.

It was on the homebrew club that Apple was born, from Steve Wozniak idea
of a perfect computer and Jobs market view. At the time that Apple started
there was a lot of computer business emerging, like processor technology.
Apple was the underdog, and surprised everyone.

About the 80's, when Apple was starting, the spirit of openness started
to give way to industrial secrets. But along with that there was great
effort to create standards, like S-100 bus (based on the Altair).

In the end hackers where able to start a revolution that no big company
at the time thought it was possible (not a single one of them invested on
personal computers).

Apple got it right developing an open architecture, that was easy to extend,
thanks to Wozniak view. This made Apple the first big hit on personal computers
and paved the way for a new market that would generate a new generation
of hackers and a billionaire industry.

## Hacking clash with the industry

The Apple 2 started a marked for personal computers games
that generated a lot of revenue. The book focuses a lot on
Sierra Online, a company from Ken and Roberta Williams.

They started with a game that they tried to sell to apple but
got ignored. Ironically later they would do the same thing when
they got bigger and lost a game of the year because of that.

They started with sheer hacker energy, paying good royalties and
relying on creativity from hackers. In time, as money poured in,
Ken Williams started to want to use more "industry level" programmers
to do the games instead of "prima dona" hackers, that where less
predictable and behaved like artists.

In the end a company named Eletronic Arts started and got a lot
of Sierra Online talent promising the same freedom that Sierra one had.
Both companies exists today yet, none of them retain the hacker
spirit, and none of them are innovative and brilliant, although
both still makes a profit.

The industry changed the hacking landscape, but there will
always be those that are moved by sheer curiosity and desire
for knowledge, that loves what they do, people where the
system is the end in itself, like a masterpiece. It will be
interesting how this will fold on the future, in the past it
was more comfortable to do research, there was a lot of government
investment. These days we have to complect hacking with
business, which brings in a heavy baggage of money driven people
and marketing. The clash of these cultures is one of my
deepest challenges, since today I still have no idea on how to
handle that.

Perhaps it is a natural cycle of software in business, in time
people will only want the money and will make a way to get that
without the sheer power of innovation and creativity, which are
less predictable. It is easier to bet on this when there is
nothing to lose. This makes me remind of the saying
"You die a hero or you live enough to become the villain".
