# Hackers, heroes of the computer revolution

This book is fucking awesome is so much ways that is even
hard to transcribe.

## What is a hack

First of all it goes right in the origin of the term hack.
So there is no more confusion on what is a hack, it is where the
term originated, people had a purpose with it, and it was magnificent.

It was basically anything that you worked on (not necessarily programming)
that you did just for the joy of being involved on the work, doing it pleased
you. The term was coined to differentiate from works that where related to
classes or to a job, that sometimes where constructive and useful, but
ultimately boring.

A hack was something that you enjoyed, was fun, and ultimately had to be
smart. A complete new way to look at a problem. An example of how useless the
problem could be is one of the first programs wrote by the first hackers at MIT
on the TX-0. A converser from arabic numbers to roman. It was
extremely hard to implement a complete and correct one with the limitations
of the TX-0, but it was completely useless, no one ever used it.

The fun was in taking the challenge, solving it, and them trying to solve it
on a more clever way, using fewer instructions (called "bumming" the code).

The hackers never thought that information should be hidden, they where also
proficient lock breakers (physical ones). But they never stole anything, never
made money from it, it was the pure challenge that attracted them.

Putting a wall or a lock, was the challenge, and the challenge had to be
tackled with clever solutions, but it was just that. This was done on the
spirit of free information flow, that always contributed to better solutions
since hackers could always improve on previous work.

Hacking is pure greatness, it is bliss, love is a bigger motivator than duty,
and was love that was happening at the beginning of hacking.

There was no product, no royalties, no patents.

## The Right Way

This is one of the ideas that struck me more. There was a pursuit for the best
solution to problems that was beautiful and fun. Even when you worked on top
of someone solution, was to make it better, or even rollout your own new solution.

There was no idea of just using stuff to build products faster. An example is
when they received a new PDP-1 computer and just rewrote all the utilities programs
since the ones that came with the computer where not good enough, they where
not done the "right way".

People today think it is wrong to think that there is a right way, because it
implies a wrong one, and they lack the spirit to conflict.

These early hackers thrived on conflicts, it was not about ego's, they just cared.
They would discuss for hours subjects that seemed like a utterly time loss.
This immediately reminded me of my dynamic with one of my greatest friends,
he is as hacker as hackers can get, it really struck'ed me deeply that this is
what was missing more on my life.

I convinced my life that I was not being pragmatic and not generating value,
but to be honest, in my hearth, the feeling that moves me is "fuck value, this
is fun". Conciliating this with making a living is necessary, but I inverted
the priority of these things in my life and I got in trouble because of that.

## Homebrew Computer Club

Elaborate on the sharing that happened at this time.
The Altair, MITS.
How Apple started, open architecture.
And how IBM followed

## Hacking clash with the industry

This started at 1980 with the game industry.
Elaborate on On Line's (Sierra) history.
The conflict between giving visibility and credits
to hackers and making programming an anonymous activity
to make it cheaper.
