# XP Explained

The greatest part of the book are the values and principles, since they
can be applied on a very great range of ways, and are just focused on human needs.

The book already starts with the notion that removing the human factor of a methodology
or process to develop software does not make sense and it will inevitably fail.

That makes sense to me, since we are all humans.

## Core Values

* Communication
* Feedback
* Simplicity
* Courage
* Respect

Just great :-). And of course courage must be balanced with good sense and the needs of the
team, it is not a hero approach to courage.


## Principles

### Mutual benefit

I really found this to be pretty cool. I always preferred refactoring + clear code + tests
than extensive documentation. And finally I got a good idea on expressing why is that.

When you are just writing a lot of documentation, you are doing something that is only
valuable to other persons (or even yourself) on the future. On the present time, there is no gain
at all on extensive documentation, you already now what the code does, it is boring as hell, because of that.
You are just not getting anything out of it right now.

But if you are writing tests, well, it is challenging, it is hard, it proves that the code you just wrote
works... it is FUN. You got a benefit right now, and later you will have regression tests + good examples
on how to use your API, it is a WIN WIN situation. The same goes for refactoring and well written code,
it just makes you fell warm and fuzzy inside :-) (documentation never does that for me :-().

So, the principle is to always aim at practices that gives benefits right now and on the future, not
just the future...and not just right now.
