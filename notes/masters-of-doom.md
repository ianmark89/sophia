# Masters of Doom

All the revolution that happened on the eighty's was possible because
of the increase of accessibility on the game market.

Developing for consoles involved very expensive tools and hardware, which
means having to work for a big corporation to sponsor you.

On the story of the two Johns, they were able to pursue their dreams and do
awesome stuff because they only needed an Apple 2 and a IBM PC (8086) and time
to develop games.

Both started developing at home, working on totally unrelated stuff, like burger king.
It is indeed an amazing story how they fought to be able to do what they love.

This increase on accessibility is similar to what happened with the web revolution at the
nineties and is similar with what is happening today (2016) with the cloud.


## Key points

* Carmack wanted to craft great programs, Romero wanted to build an empire
* Romero had the ability to perceive change when he started to invest on IBM PC instead of Apple 2
* Carmack hates patents, identified myself a lot with this (people have to be able to extend ideas)
