# The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined

This book provides an interesting view on a subject that usually is
treated as a certainty, that violence is going from bad to worse.

It seems counter intuitive that violence is declining since we live so
near the century where we had the first two world wars, but the author
makes a very good point on showing that the way almost all societies
see violence has indeed changed, even the perception that we have of
the two world wars show differences on the human psychology today that
may indicate that violence will decline even further.

I'm not a very positive person and I'm not very fond to the idea that
human beings are good. But neither does the author, quoting from him:

```
We are not inherently bad nor inherently good
```

We just want to survive, and with the exceptions of psychopaths and
some outliers, usually violence is a means to get to an end, not the
end itself. Pretty much on the beginning of the book he tries to argue
that we don't need violence, he calls that a "hydraulic model" of how
violence works, like when we are not being violent this violence piles
up inside of us and we need to let it out.

Proving anything that is related to human behavior is almost impossible
to me, there is always an outlier or some doubt that you can raise on
why people do what they do. But he makes a lot of good points involving
the practical reasons to use violence and the difference on the use of
violence when people are exposed to different exogenous forces.

This is one of the basis of the book and it makes sense to me, the idea
that exogenous forces changes our behavior in a great deal, something like
"we are shaped by our environment".

Along the book there is a plethora of statistics and information regarding
how violence is lower today than was in the past. A lot of things are pretty
surprising, but it makes sense to see the past as a very violent place, specially
if you take a look on the instruments used for torture on medieval times.
And is not just torture, the way violence was used on entertainment is
astonishing, we have similar things on movies but people usually are
appalled by real violence, in older times violence and death where much
more acceptable, specially because they where accepted as normal and
welcomed by the society (think about people gathering on a town square
to stone someone).

His point is that civilization is a force that promotes less violence
than more violence as much people believe, like in the old days people
where more pacific and wars like the two world wars are an artifact
built from our new civilization era. To be honest that doesn't make
any sense to me since war was always a part of the human history, just
the tools to fight it changed. The important aspect to note is the
reaction of us human beings as a society to it, comparing to how it
was seen on the past.

But the core idea is, we are not bad or good, we just want to live
our lives well. There are different ways that we can do that as a
community, some of them can propel us to use more violence, others
don't, simply because it is more advantageous to not use violence.

This was a very interesting aspect of the book to me, because it is
not about morality or how human beings are good and caring. It just
explores how civilization is a way to live in communities that catalyzes
other human traits, as empathy, instead of direct aggression. But it
does so on a total selfish way, people don't abandon violence because
it is morally wrong, they do it when it is better to them, when it improves
their chance of surviving.

Some people do abandon violence for moral reasons, but I don't believe
that is a good basis for changes on the scale discussed on the book (entire
societies). To a change to be observed on an entire country it has to
have some practical reasons behind it.

The book is pretty long but I will try to create a mental model of
what are the exogenous forces that can help humans be less violent
and more collaborative. Empiric evidence of my own life shows that
people can excel at both, it makes sense that environmental factors
can push you on one direction or another.
