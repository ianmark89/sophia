# The Vietnam War

Well it is kinda weird to have notes about the vietnam war
in the middle of notes that seem related to computer science
only. Perhaps it is because this project is changing with me as
I give more tought on social issues, but in the case of the
vietnam war the focus still is to compare it with some problems
in managing software that I have observed.

It seems odd at first to compare a war with software development,
but since a lot of the problems that we have with software development
are caused by people and psicological human traits it makes sense
to see some parallels.

This is based on what I saw on the great documentary
[The Vietnam War](http://www.pbs.org/kenburns/the-vietnam-war/home/).

# The Sunk Cost Fallacy

Perhaps the most obvious lesson is about sunk cost. Quoting from
[here](https://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/03/25/the-sunk-cost-fallacy/):

```
The Truth: Your decisions are tainted by the emotional
investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in
something the harder it becomes to abandon it.
```

This one is not hard to explain since it is pretty obvious that
the vietnam war was harder and harder to abandon as the USA
government got more invested and did not wanted to "lose face".

I have seem the same thing happen with software projects, both on the
business side as in the technical side, where design ideas are obviously
not working well but people are so emotionally invested that it
seems impractical to abandon the idea and start over again.

# Extensive Progress Reports and Metrics

As the war effort escalated and the results did not seem favorable
the amount of extensive and detailed reports sent to the USA started
to raise to a level that was impossible at the time to be analyzed
(it was done mostly manually, CIRCA 1965). Yet these reports where
being written anyway, even if no one was reading it.

This reminds me of an experience I had with software development where
something very similar happened. As projects around the company stopped
to progress and development got stuck more micromanaging happened and
more detailed documentation on where time and effort was being spent.
The amount of detail was not going to be analyzed by anyone, ever, because
it did not made sense to have such a fine grained detail of what was happening
because this was not what was going to solve the problem.

Solving the actual problem was pretty hard, perhaps it is a psycological
trait that when faced with a certain amount of uncertainty
the quest for this kinda of detailed
information starts to make sense. But truth is that the only way to really have
a good insight on what was happening on the projects was to get involved
on the day to day work and to talk with the people "on the trenches".
The reports where on the thousands of pages per month level, it shows
the desperation that is commonly found on over managed and documented failing
software projects. In the end you can see that the war really looks like a failing
software project because a failing project is a failing project and the behavior
around the software projects where not introduced by computing, they are a human trait.

But high management usually don't get involved on the details, sometimes
for economic/practical reasons (the president of the USA cant get personally
involved on all problems, or go to a war zone, even tough it would be the
best way for him to asses the situation). They just want numbers and to
know if there is progress. Sometimes this is possible, but on unusual environments
it is not and then another fallacy can happen which is to measure the wrong thing.

A cool phrase on the documentary is that "we are slaves of our previous experiences".
The Vietnam war was pretty unique in a lot of senses, they where not gaining territory
like in World War 2, the war was being fought on a very different and diffuse way
and them it surfaces another cool phrase that goes something like this:

```
When you can't measure what is important, you make what you
can measure important
```

In the case of the Vietnam war the only thing that was easy to measure
was body count, so progress started to be measured in how much vietnamese
were killed. What was the result ? Beyond fake numbers there was also the common
practice of not discriminating between dead civilians and dead soldiers, a
dead vietnamese was a dead vietnamese. Acceptance of the US forces from
the people around them would be much more useful, but it is much harder to
measure and report.

The problem of focusing on what is easy to measure
and to report is that it may not indicate true progress and may even
have negative effects, like the lack of restrain on the use of deadly
force, even when unecessary, which only made the US look bad and loose
the confidence of the people they where supposed to help.

Measuring the success of something as complicated as the war effort,
which involved the opnion and feelings of the people towards the
american troups is extremelly hard, perhaps even impossible, but measuring
the wrong thing instead does not help at all.

In software the common "dead bodies count" is bugs count. Counting bugs
opened and closed is extremelly easy. It is just as easy to measure
as it is easy to fake. Well, clients don't like bugs, what is the problem
with that ? It is the wrong incentive, if bugs count is the metric
of the quality of your job you have no incentive to be transparent
about it, every bug that you find and tell no one about it the better.

The problem of course is that assessing the quality of software is very hard.
It involves experienced developers involved on the project, reading the code,
implemeting features, solving the bugs and them open communication about the
issues. Not one of these things is very easy to measure and to people
just interested on numbers it is very hard to do things this way, communicating
and feeling things.

It sounds very odd to work with feelings, but everytime I worked on a environment
that was thriving everyone felt it, and when things where going bad people also
knew that. Of course these people are the ones involved in the project
in a daily basis, not a manager that just looks from a safe distance once a month.

The lesson is not to use metrics, but that sometimes they are very hard to get
and when faced with that situation choosing something that is easy to measure
may create the wrong incentive system and makes things even worse.
