## Why nerds are not popular at school

High school is basically a place to put children while the parents are at work. On our era
you need a lot of time and education to be productive, since kids cant help with anything
economic, they must be placed on some place while the parents are at work.

The school has no practical value, you study a lot of stuff, but nothing is applicable on the
moment. Also there is no adult mentor guiding the kids on practical stuff, giving them guidance and
hierarchy. Since humans always build hierarchical relationships it is up to the kids to build them,
since kids are essentially stupid they will build hierarchy based on stupid stuff, like appearance or
being good at sports.

It is not very different from a prison, the adults there wont allow the kids to kill each other, but
everything besides killing is permitted, as bullying of all kinds. Bullying happens because kids 
that are not on the top of the hierarchy are confused about their place, and need to humiliate someone
to be able to get up on the hierarchy (at least on their minds).

Nerds are not popular because they dont want to. Of course they dont like being humiliated, and they
want to be popular...but they want to be smart more than being popular, so they end up studying cool
stuff instead of investing on the things that would make them popular.
