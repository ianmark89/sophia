# Talent Is Overrated

For me this book is specially great in helping me understand why I can
eventually do good stuff and how I got where I am now. Specially because
I never thought about myself as a gifted person, I just work hard.

Working hard, that is the funny thing on life and that always puzzled me.
There is a lot of people that works hard, every day, and don't seem to get nowhere.
That always puzzled me, because at least for me, I just always did that and
thing where a little different, it seemed that I could do more things than
most people, but I never felt specially gifted or faster. I just spend a lot of time
with the problems I found interesting.

To be honest, I think I'm pretty slow. I have to think about something for a long long
time before having a decent idea. And understanding new concepts is not particularly fast
for me. The idea of reading this book was helping me understand this better. What makes
people be great at what they do ? (obviously that is what I'm trying to do, but without
thinking too much on how, just doing what it seems to make sense... now I want to understand
in details why what I'm doing seems to work, and what is lacking on people that does
not seem to be making progress).

It's not that I'm the best software developer on the face of earth, not even where I work.
But its also pointless to fake that my performance is average, because it simply not.
I believed for a long time on that, but I got too much feedback that it is not, so there is
no point on insisting on that. Of course that I really believe that I have a long way to go
to be really good on what I do, but until now, I'm going pretty well.

So, enough about me. What does the book say about talent ? Well, it has a lot of researches
that points to the fact that even people that seem to be pretty good even when they where young
have started practicing, and where actively trained (usually by their parents), even at
younger ages.

If someone was amazingly well at age 10, that person started practicing at an age of 4. And that is it.
All people that are remarkably well at what they do, early on their life just started to
practice very early, and they kept practicing every day. There was a extreme correlation with how
much they practiced and how good they where. No sign of divine spark or special talent was there.

I'm not going to say that this is a universal truth, but for me it makes a lot of sense. And in my
case it makes sense. But, again we are presented with the problem of people working a lot of time with
the same thing and not getting any better. To make things more odd, some people get worse with time, even
doing the same job every day. So the problem lies on what we understand as practice. How is this practice ?
It does not seem to be just doing stuff like you always do for a lot of hours, or a lot of people would
be great at what they do, and life is not like that.

The idea of **Deliberate Practice** is where things start to get fun.


## Deliberate Practice

The real deal to be great at what you do is deliberate practice. But what the hell is deliberate practice ?
Well the core concept of what it is, is this:

* It can be repeated a lot
* It is not fun
* It is mentally exhausting
* It needs continuous feedback

Since you need to practice a lot, it has be something that you can repeat a lot. Not being fun is related to being
mentally exhausting. It requires for you to be deliberately thinking about everything that you are doing while you are
practicing, so it will annoy your mind, that usually likes to sit and relax :-).

Feedback is required because you need to understand if you are actually getting better. How do you know that a variation
on how you do stuff produces better result ? Seeing that is very hard. That is why in sports even the best players
still have coach's, they need feedback from someone that is watching them from outside.

The idea that all this is a lot of work makes a lot of sense, since it does describe why there is so little great
performers in the world, its because its not easy or fun. People like the idea of the gifted person because it
makes them feel better with themselves, but its not true.

Almost all examples on the book are about chess players and sports. I was having a real hard time connecting this
with software development, which is what I do. There is one thing that I read on the book about Tiger Woods that
helped me to start making the right connections. The fact that Tiger Woods can stop on the middle of a shot when
he is interrupted, because he is not on automatic mode, he is actively thinking about every little thing he is doing
on his shot, and if he is interrupted he can stop instead of justing shotting it all wrong as most people would do
(because they are usually on auto pilot while doing that, having fun). The phrase from the book Pragmatic Thinking and
Learning is:

* You cant steer on auto pilot

The book already talked about the danger of auto pilot, and as soon as I read the Tiger Woods thing It clicked. It
was all about that (ok its not JUST that, but the bulk of it seems to be related to the auto mode).

The automatic mode is what enables us to be alive and not go completely crazy. Humans have a phase where they learn
something new, they practice it until it can be done on their sub conscience, and as soon it gets on that level
you can perform the same way you did before, without even thinking about it. Notice that you cant get any better this way,
just repeat the performance, because that is what the auto mode is all about, conserving energy and freeing your
mind to think about other things.

This is great to stuff like driving, but terrible to stuff like writing software, or anything that you intent to be
really great at.

Some odd things to think about:

* Programming is about solving complex problems, can you really do it without thinking ?
* Almost everyone that I know that is good at programming likes to do it, so how it is not going to be fun ?

The fun thing is startling, all the great developers seem to have fun doing it, so where is the no fun part ?
This is important to understand since it seems to be the difference between greatness and average.

Now I will start to talk about a lot of stuff that is not on the book, but they make sense to me.
