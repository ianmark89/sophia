# Talent Is Overrated

For me this book is specially great in helping me understand why I can
eventually do good stuff and how I got where I am now. Specially because
I never thought about myself as a gifted person, I just work hard.

Working hard, that is the funny thing on life and that always puzzled me.
There is a lot of people that works hard, every day, and don't seem to get nowhere.
That always puzzled me, because at least for me, I just always did that and
thing where a little different, it seemed that I could do more things than
most people, but I never felt specially gifted or faster. I just spend a lot of time
with the problems I found interesting.

To be honest, I think I'm pretty slow. I have to think about something for a long long
time before having a decent idea. And understanding new concepts is not particularly fast
for me. The idea of reading this book was helping me understand this better. What makes
people be great at what they do ? (obviously that is what I'm trying to do, but without
thinking too much on how, just doing what it seems to make sense... now I want to understand
in details why what I'm doing seems to work, and what is lacking on people that does
not seem to be making progress).

It's not that I'm the best software developer on the face of earth, not even where I work.
But its also pointless to fake that my performance is average, because it simply not.
I believed for a long time on that, but I got too much feedback that it is not, so there is
no point on insisting on that. Of course that I really believe that I have a long way to go
to be really good on what I do, but until now, I'm going pretty well.

So, enough about me. What does the book say about talent ? Well, it has a lot of researches
that points to the fact that even people that seem to be pretty good even when they where young
have started practicing, and where actively trained (usually by their parents), even at
younger ages.

If someone was amazingly well at age 10, that person started practicing at an age of 4. And that is it.
All people that are remarkably well at what they do, early on their life just started to
practice very early, and they kept practicing every day. There was a extreme correlation with how
much they practiced and how good they where. No sign of divine spark or special talent was there.

I'm not going to say that this is a universal truth, but for me it makes a lot of sense. And in my
case it makes sense. But, again we are presented with the problem of people working a lot of time with
the same thing and not getting any better. To make things more odd, some people get worse with time, even
doing the same job every day. So the problem lies on what we understand as practice. How is this practice ?
It does not seem to be just doing stuff like you always do for a lot of hours, or a lot of people would
be great at what they do, and life is not like that.

The idea of **Deliberate Practice** is where things start to get fun.


## Deliberate Practice

The real deal to be great at what you do is deliberate practice, not just practicing.
But what the hell is deliberate practice ?

Well the core concept of what it is, is this:

* It can be repeated a lot
* It is not fun
* It is mentally exhausting
* It needs continuous feedback

Since you need to practice a lot, it has be something that you can repeat a lot. Not being fun is related to being
mentally exhausting. It requires for you to be deliberately thinking about everything that you are doing while you are
practicing, so it will annoy your mind, that usually likes to sit and relax :-).

Feedback is required because you need to understand if you are actually getting better. How do you know that a variation
on how you do stuff produces better result ? Seeing that is very hard. That is why in sports even the best players
still have coach's, they need feedback from someone that is watching them from outside.

The idea that all this is a lot of work makes a lot of sense, since it does describe why there is so little great
performers in the world, its because its not easy or fun. People like the idea of the gifted person because it
makes them feel better with themselves, but its not true.

Almost all examples on the book are about chess players and sports. I was having a real hard time connecting this
with software development, which is what I do. There is one thing that I read on the book about Tiger Woods that
helped me to start making the right connections. The fact that Tiger Woods can stop on the middle of a swing when
he is interrupted.

Normal golf players will just make the shot, horribly. But he can stop on the middle of it, take a step back, recompose
himself, and come forth again to do the shot. How can he do this ? because he is not on automatic mode,
he is actively thinking about every little thing he is doing
on his shot, and if he is interrupted he can stop instead of justing shotting it all wrong as most people would do
(because they are usually on auto pilot while doing that, having fun, its not a deliberate action).
The phrase from the book Pragmatic Thinking and Learning book that I remembered is:

* You cant steer on auto pilot

The book already talked about the danger of auto pilot, and as soon as I read the Tiger Woods thing It clicked. It
was all about that (ok its not JUST that, but the bulk of it seems to be related to the auto mode).

The automatic mode is what enables us to be alive and not go completely crazy. Humans have a phase where they learn
something new, they practice it until it can be done on their sub conscience, and as soon it gets on that level
you can perform the same way you did before, without even thinking about it. Notice that you cant get any better this way,
just repeat the performance, because that is what the auto mode is all about, conserving energy and freeing your
mind to think about other things.

This is great to stuff like driving, since you just want to get to places, but terrible to stuff like writing software,
or anything that you intent to be really great at.

Some odd things to think about:

* Programming is about solving complex problems, can you really do it without thinking ?
* Almost everyone that I know that is good at programming likes to do it, so how it is not going to be fun ?

The fun thing is startling, all the great developers seem to have fun doing it, so where is the no fun part ?
This is important to understand since it seems to be the difference between greatness and average.

Now I will start to talk about a lot of stuff that is not on the book, but they make sense to me.


## Deliberate Practice on Software

Ok, now it is the time for reflection. I really love what I do, but the book started me to think about
the "have fun" thing. Do I really always have fun when developing software ? Where the satisfaction comes
from ? Are there any pain points ?

Before dwelling on these questions, lets think a little about what is not deliberate practice on software
development, the root of all evil.


### The root of all evil

The root of all evil on software development, for me at least, is the **the important thing is that it works**.
Every single person that I met that thinks like that, does a very average/poor job at developing software.
This really pisses me off. When you think about great software design, doing what the user needs is really
fundamental. But it is the most basic parameter to measure quality of your solution, it is poor and lazy,
and it enables you do do everything on automatic mode, just do what you always have done on the last years
all over again, and if shit barely works, well, good enough I can go home.

On this mode of software development it is really possible to be on automatic, even when handling with complex
problems. You are not thinking about a lot of variables like:

* How people are going to understand this later
* How it will recover from errors
* How it will evolve without regressions
* What is the impact of the decisions that I'm making on the rest of the system

You just do what you already know until you can see the answer you expected to be printed on the screen and
you are good to go. There is no space for feedback or improvement, or reviews, it only matters that it is
"working". The most interesting is that people that works like that and usually seems to value this, do not
even deliver fully working shit, just half baked shit that works for some time, because there is no real
thought on their work, and when you see software like that you can see the lack of thought.

Our industry if filled with people like that, the world is, because it is what makes more sense for nature.
You need to conserve energy, not use a lot of energy. But when you conserve energy there is little space
for innovation, just for survival (pressure is also a trigger for this kind of behaviour).

If you want to do good stuff on software, forget the **but it works** crap. Working is the most basic thing
expected from you, and there is a lot of other stuff that you are supposed to do besides that.

Ok now that I was able to rant about how much I despise the "it works" shit, we can talk about cool stuff
that makes great developers.


### Deliberate software development

Well, as stated before, the secret is to not stay on automatic mode. The automatic mode is the way
our brain have to make us comfortable, and we like comfort. So if you want to be increasingly getting
better on what you do, you must not be comfortable for a long period of time (you need periods of
comfort to avoid your brain from burnout, and yes, everyone burns out eventually).

One important thing to note is that since deliberate practice is mentally exhausting. The researches
showed that usually the max amount of time doing it per day is approximately 4 hours. The human brain
simply cant take much more than it per day. So when you are developing there will be times that you
will need to just code on a more comfortable way.

I supposed that this is the moment when code that
have to be refactored is born :-), and it is just a reality, no one can write deliberate great
software for a long period of hours, sometimes the bad design will slip. There is a lot of
techniques that can mitigate that, there are also mechanisms to get feedback.

Now lets get to a list of practices that good developers usually do, that distinguishes them.


#### Design matters

Just writing lots of code is not enough. Good developers care a lot about design.
Thinking about software design meets all the criteria of deliberate practice:

* It can be repeated a lot (you can always do that)
* It is not fun
* It is mentally exhausting
* It needs continuous feedback

The fun part is learning new design approaches, but the feeling good only happens after the new
design is born, and you see it in action, seeing it working gives you great satisfaction.
But the process of coming up with a good design is really hard. It takes time (and pressure to start coding
stuff starts to pile up), and it takes a lot of good people to brainstorm, and it takes the
desire to not just go with the first idea that comes up to your mind.

Of course this is a continuous activity, the idea is not to do a big upfront design, and the
catch to understand that is the continuous feedback loop and the repeating.

Big upfront design is usually a bad idea because it lacks the "repeating a lot" from deliberate practice,
since you are going to do it on the start of the project, them it will only be coding.
And it will lack continuous feedback too, you will only get one big **you suck** feedback at the end.

Design can only give feedback when used by the intended users. If you are designing an API, you need
to use it to have feedback. That is why it makes no sense to pass too much time only designing
and having no feedback.

There is a nice spot on brainstorming about design, think about it, do some coding, and them
revisit the design with the feedback. Since the feedback is about code on this case, the developers
that are working with the code need to give this feedback.

I see very few people willing to really stress design choices, alternatives and brainstorm the tradeoffs
of different design choices. It is a reflection of the "no fun" thing. Working with a good design is
fun, coming up with one is not, it is hard deliberate work. It just does not pop up naturally.

One example that popped on my head is how arrays and slices works on golang. It took one year from 4 very
experienced people to come up with it, it is a sign of hard deliberate thought.

Since incremental design seems like the best way to achieve true deliberate practice on software development
it is good to think on alternative ways to get the feedback about your design, besides the obvious feedback
of the users (by the way, great design usually happens when the developer is also a user of what
he is developing. More on that on this [great Paul Graham essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html) )

Now, some ways to get feedback about your design decisions.


##### Code review / Pair programming


##### Time + Change

Bend or break :-)


##### Test First Programming

It was while I was writing about how design is a deliberate/exhausting practice that I noticed
how wrong the names TDD and BDD are. Behaviour wont drive design, tests wont drive design, only
a human mind can drive a design.

This totally makes sense with the fact that a lot of unexperienced people will come up
with a shitty totally tested design when doing TDD. TDD can only help you to get feedback
about your design. But feedback only helps you if you listen for it, and experience plays a great
deal on interpreting feedback.

Today I like the test first programming term better than TDD, it dont gives you the illusion
that writing tests before will drive your design, it wont. It may help you have better tests,
and even this depends greatly on your experience.

Lots of people do great job with TDD because they are experienced and do a great job coming
up with great designs and are good at refactoring. Again, refactoring is the thing generating
deliberate practice.

Having said that, I usually like to write my tests first, and treating tests as a first class
citizens on my day to day life was one of the choices that made me do a great deal of deliberate
thinking and practice on my work. Testing is hard, having to always think about that helps me
to be always improving and stretching to do things better and differently.

Again, just working (printing stuff on the screen) is not enough. So if you feel stuck and
want to improve, start to think on how to automate validation of your software, it is orders
of magnitude harder than just writing the software, and hard is good.


#### Avoiding comfort and automatic pilot

* Learn new languages / paradigms
* Change work domain
* Change how you get things done (TDD for example)
* Core quality: curiosity


#### Mentoring / Coaching


* At work
* Open source
