# Talent Is Overrated

For me this book is specially great in helping me understand why I can
eventually do good stuff and how I got where I am now. Specially because
I never thought about myself as a gifted person, I just work hard.

Working hard, that is the funny thing on life and that always puzzled me.
There is a lot of people that works hard, every day, and don't seem to get nowhere.
That always puzzled me, because at least for me, I just always did that and
thing where a little different, it seemed that I could do more things than
most people, but I never felt specially gifted or faster.

To be honest, I think I'm pretty slow. I have to think about something for a long long
time before having a decent idea. And understanding new concepts is not particularly fast
for me. The idea of reading this book was helping me understand this better. What makes
people be great at what they do ? (obviously that is what I'm trying to do, but without
thinking too much on how, just doing what it seems to make sense... now I want to understand
in details why what I'm doing seems to work, and what is lacking on people that does
not seem to be making progress).

It's not that I'm the best software developer on the face of earth, not even where I work.
But its also pointless to fake that my performance is average, because it simply not.
I believed for a long time on that, but I got too much feedback that it is not, so there is
no point on insisting on that. Of course that I really believe that I have a long way to go
to be really good on what I do, but until now, I'm going pretty well.

So, enough about me. What does the book say about talent ? Well, it has a lot of researches
that points to the fact that even people that seem to be pretty good even when they where young
have started practicing, and where actively trained (usually by their parents), even at
younger ages.

If someone was amazingly well at age 10, that person started practicing at an age of 4. And that is it.
All people that are remarkably well at what they do, early on their life just started to
practice very early, and they kept practicing every day. There was a extreme correlation with how
much they practiced and how good they where. No sign of divine spark or special talent was there.

I'm not going to say that this is a universal truth, but for me it makes a lot of sense. And in my
case it makes sense. But, again we are presented with the problem of people working a lot of time with
the same thing and not getting any better. To make things more odd, some people get worse with time, even
doing the same job every day. So the problem lies on what we understand as practice. How is this practice ?
It does not seem to be just doing stuff like you always do for a lot of hours, or a lot of people would
be great at what they do, and life is not like that.
