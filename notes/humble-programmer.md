# Humble Programmer

The article does a great introduction to the concept
of software being "intelectually manageable" which is a cool
way to say "I'm able to understand this shit".

As usual the more recorrent subject on software quality
is the ability to understand code that has been already written.
Writing a lot of messy code is easy, developing something easy
to read and understand is hard.

It raises the issue if software complexity must grow exponentially
or linearly with the size of the problem. On Dijkstra opnion it is
possible to be linear, and the only way to do that is to factor
code correctly, so our limited minds can grasp the complexity of
software on one piece of a time.

A key piece of this is abstraction. The purpose of abstraction is
not be vague, but to create a new semantic level and be precise
on this new semantic level. This kind of isolation from other
details is what enables us to get a good grip on each part of
the solution to a possible big problem, the way to scale 
software development.  Good abstractions are crucial.

Another cool aspect of the article is the obvious idea that
we are very limited, phrases like:

```
The competent programmer is fully aware of the
strictly limited size of his own skull.
```

One of our limitations is the tool we use to express
our thoughts, the language we use, that is why the choice
of language is by far the most important one, the ways
you can conceive a solution to a problem is limited by
the language you are using. The expressiveness of the language
will limit how far you can think on solutions to the problem.

Sometimes we think it is not like that, we like to think that
we are awesome, but we are not, the languagem you choose will
limit you. That is another way to be humble, realize that
and search for good modest languages to develop in, they
are going to enable you, or limit you.

Programming is hard, approach it with respect.

## Bike Shedding

I never knew exactly why people used the expression
**bike shedding** to refer to stupid discussions.

On this article Dijkstra tells the origin of this expression,
it is a psicological fact about humans, the more important a decision
is people will tend to discuss stupid details instead of discussing
the real serious issues that actually have to be addressed.

The bike shed story is a reference to this phenomenon, a group
of enginneers where responsible to building a nuclear power
plant. Instead of discussing real design decisions they spent more
than a month just discussing where and how the bike shed of the
power plant would be built. That is the origin of the 
**bike shedding** expression.
